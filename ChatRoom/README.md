# ChatRoom

## How it works
  
First you run server.py on the server, in our case its localhost. Next you run client.py, give nickname and connect to the server. Now clients can chat with each other.

## Known bugs
  
A client canâ€™t see it when another client sends a message because client.py always asks for input, because of this you need to give input or press enter before the message will be shown.
